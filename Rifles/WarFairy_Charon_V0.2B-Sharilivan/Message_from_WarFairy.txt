What you see before you is the product of a lot of hours, sleepless nights, and obsessive thought of how to bring the best possible firearms to the internet.

You now posess the data to create seven different firearms (well, ok, six, but the two unbuffered pistols have different grip shapes). Each with slightly different characteristics so you can print the firearm YOU want.

Do as you please with these files, but please rename them should you make your own release so that we don't get cross-compatibility issues or anything like that, and please don't try to pass off unmodified files as your own. That's just not nice.

Chop em up, remix them, twist them, tweak them, make them your own or give them to everyone you know.

The internet knows no borders or boundaries. No nationality. No religion. In this stream of 1's and 0's, we are all equal. We are all free. Use that freedom.

WarFairy, out.
