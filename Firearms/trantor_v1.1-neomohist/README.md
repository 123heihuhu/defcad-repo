# Trantor Trantor Revolver 224

#### Version
v1.1

#### Description
Trantor Revolver 224 v.1.1 is released under a GPLv3 license. No warranty of any sort is issued. 

This system was designed as a research tool and project, a proof of concept for a research paper. 

Formats included are STL, DXF, STEP, and SLDPRT. 

#### Disclaimer

For US legal requirements, a piece of metal can be epoxied into the space above the trigger (within the frame), and beneath the mainspring. 

Likewise, components can be made out of metal instead of polymers. This allows for metal parts that should metal US legal requirements as well. 

A nail (perhaps an 8d/10 gauge or 10d/9 gauge one) can be inserted in the tube above the system for use as a firing pin. 

For additional assembly information, see enclosed picture files. 4 frame pins are required, as well as glue.  

Simulations indicate that .22 Short may function well, but more than one use of .22 LR may cause deformation. 

Again, no warranty is issued. All usage is done at individual risk. Adherence to local laws is highly recommended.
