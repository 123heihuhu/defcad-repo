# WarFairy Arms AR-15 Belt Magazine Pouch


#### Description
This should be relatively straight forward. It is a printable pouch for your AR-15 magazine. It is set up for Right Handed shooters, I am still working on a left hand version, though there is nothing stopping left handers from using it, it is just a little more awkward.

You will need Glue and Sandpaper.

#### Printing:
You will need to print one of each file EXCEPT the "Full Belt Clip" and your choice of either the pouch with text or slick.

Print all parts of the belt clip flat side down. Print Clip Peg with wide face down. Print Magazine Pouch with magazine catch at the top rather than the bottom. Support material is recommended to be turned on for Pouch and Belt Clip Part 3.

#### Post-Print:
Ensure that magazine catch on pouch has support material cleaned out from beneath latch tab and from around latch that protrudes into pouch cavity. Magazine catch should be stiff, but able to move freely.

Ensure that Belt Clip Part 1's 8 spring tabs are able to flex freely to allow rotation of pouch.

#### Assembly:

Gently sand the shaft of the clip peg until it gives little resistance through large hole in the side of the pouch body. DO NOT GLUE IN PLACE. Press clip peg through Pouch body from the inside so that the wide face faces towards the inside of the pouch, leaaving the shaft protruding outwards.

Glue belt clip part 1 and 2 together so that center holes are aligned. Apply glue only to the two raised circular faces of Belt Clip part 2, spreading the glue evenly for solid holding. Once glue is cured, press onto shaft of Clip Peg. Carefully glue onto peg body, ensuring that no glue gets onto interface between clip peg and pouch body. Recommended to apply glue to center hole of clip Parts 1 and 2 in a light coat to ensure assembly is able to spin.

Sand rear of belt clip part 2 and small face of Clip Peg until surfaces are level.

Apply glue to face of Belt Clip Part 3 and press onto sanded surface of clip peg and clip part 2, ensuring that Belt Clip is paralell to the Magazine Pouch body.

Allow glue to fully cure before attempting to adjust belt clip by rotating the belt clip assembly. Spring tabs of Belt Clip Part 1 should positively engage dimples in Magazine Pouch to allow for 8 different positions.

#### NOTES:
Full Belt Clip files are included for the tinkerers out there.
